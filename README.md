# WordApp

WordApp is a simple Android application developed to explore **Dependency Injection** using Hilt, **Room Database** integration, and **Data Binding** for seamless UI updates. The app allows users to manage a list of words stored locally in a database.

## Features

- **Hilt for Dependency Injection**: Provides easy dependency injection throughout the app, improving testability and modularity.
- **Room Database**: Local storage for managing the list of words.
- **Data Binding**: Used to connect UI components to data sources in XML layouts.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of concerns between UI, logic, and data handling.
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations like database queries and inserts.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**
- **Hilt**
- **Room Database**
- **LiveData & ViewModel**
- **Data Binding**
- **Coroutines**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KrishnaTech6/WordApp.git
    ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Build the project and run it on an emulator or device.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding **Dependency Injection** via Hilt.
- Implementing **Room Database** for local persistence.
- Practicing **Data Binding** instead of View Binding.
- Employing **MVVM** and **Coroutines** for scalable architecture and asynchronous programming.
